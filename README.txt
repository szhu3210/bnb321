This is the ECE 573 project of team bnb321.

The introduction video link is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRyX9Ho0JBM "Introduction of bnb321").

To open the Final release project, please double click the "project-bnb321.xcworkspace" file. Since we used an external library to process our audio signal, we integrated the library into our project. Please make sure that you double click the "xcworkspace" file. DO NOT OPEN THE XCODEPROJ FILE! If you open the xcodeproj file, it may not compile.

In the final release we implemented all the required features, including the detection of audio, FFT process, library bridging header file, FFT plot, classification, testing, etc. In this release the app is able to detect real-time audio input and calculate FFT in real time and output the FFT graph and classification result.

The license we use is MIT license since the library we integrated is in MIT license. Please refer to the LICENSE file.

If you have any questions regaring the final release, or if you have bug report, please email to szhu@email.arizona.edu.
